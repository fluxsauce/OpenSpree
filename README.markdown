# OpenSpree

*OpenSpree* is an implementation of *[Spree!](http://cheapass.com/freegames/spree)*, a board game about looting a shopping mall.

## Work in progress

OpenSpree is under active development; at this time, it is approximately 60% complete, but the interface nowhere near finished. It is not possible to complete a game yet.

For a more comprehensive breakdown of what needs to be done, see the docblock in index.php.

## Description

Springtime. Midnight. The Mall is beckoning.

Welcome to LeGrand Mall, the oldest and most poorly secured shopping mall in the world. It's as leakproof as the Titanic and as solid as a wet paper bag. This place just begs to be robbed.

Enter you. And your infantile collection of friends.

It's not enough to simply loot this mall. You have to do it with "flair." Which boils down to an allnight looting race with shopping carts, flashlights, and guns.

So park your car, dash into the mall, and load up your little red wagon. You can snitch stuff out of the stores if you like, but it’s even more fun to steal it from your friends.

This explains the guns.

## Demo

A demonstration of OpenSpree has been deployed to http://openspree.orchestra.io/ 

## Requirements

* PHP 5 or higher.

Future versions may require an Apache web server.

## Contributed code

* [PHP-Dijktra](https://github.com/kay/PHP-Dijkstra) by doug@neverfear.org is an implementaiton of Dijkstra's shortest path-algorithm.
